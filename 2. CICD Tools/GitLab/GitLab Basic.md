## 🚀 What Is GitLab?

* GitLab is a **web-based DevOps lifecycle platform** that provides a complete set of tools for **source code management (SCM), CI/CD, security, and project management** in one application.

* It is an alternative to **GitHub** and **Bitbucket**, but GitLab focuses heavily on **end-to-end DevOps workflows**.

* Diffrent GitLab we can run in docker hub but Git Hub Not. GitLab is Open Source and GitHub is used by Microshoft.

* GitLab name is Project and Github is repository.
