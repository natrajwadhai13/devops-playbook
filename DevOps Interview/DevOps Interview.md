### 🔁 Que 1) What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment? Can you explain with an example from your past project?
### ✅ **Answer**
* **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the process where developers frequently merge code changes into the main branch. This triggers automated builds and tests to ensure nothing is broken.

* **Continuous Delivery (CD)** extends CI by making sure that the code is always in a deployable state. After passing tests, it is pushed to staging or pre-prod automatically, but manual approval is required for production.

* **Continuous Deployment** goes a step further — even the production deployment is automated, with no manual approval.

* **In my current company**, we use GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Developers push code to feature branches, and a pipeline is triggered automatically for build, test, and deploy. We follow a multi-stage environment strategy:

* Code is deployed to Test1, then Test2 using Ansible. Once verified, we promote it to Production. This ensures smooth CI/CD flow and stable releases.

### 🔁 Que 2) Can you explain how you have written or used a GitLab CI/CD pipeline file (.gitlab-ci.yml)? Mention any important stages, variables, or jobs used.
### ✅ **Answer**
Yes, I’ve worked on writing and maintaining .gitlab-ci.yml files to automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

Here's a high-level structure of what we use:

```yaml

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  APP_NAME: my-node-app
  DEPLOY_ENV: staging

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building $APP_NAME"
    - npm install
    - npm run build

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - ansible-playbook deploy.yml -i inventory/$DEPLOY_ENV

```

### 🔁 Que-3 Can you explain how Ansible is used in your pipeline for deployment?

What kind of playbooks did you write or use?

What was being deployed — Docker containers, packages, Node apps, etc.?

How was inventory handled?

### ✅ **Answer**
How We Use Ansible for Deployment

In my company, I manage deployment automation for more than **18+ applications** using **Ansible**.

We follow a clear structure:

 1. **Inventory File:**
We maintain a dynamic or static inventory file where we define:

* Application name as groups (e.g., `[webapp1]`, `[dbapp1]`)
* Server IPs or hostnames
* Role tags like `web`, `app`, or `db`

 **Example:**
 
 ```ini
[web]
192.168.10.5 ansible_user=ubuntu

 [db]
192.168.10.6 ansible_user=ubuntu
```

2. **Playbooks:**
 For each application, we create separate playbooks that define tasks like:

 * Pulling code from Git repo
 * Installing dependencies
 * Managing Docker containers (if used)
 * Copying environment variables
 * Restarting services (like `nginx`, `pm2`, `node`, etc.)

 **Example snippet:**

 ```yaml
 - name: Deploy web app
   hosts: web
   tasks:
     - name: Clone repo
       git:
         repo: 'https://gitlab.com/myorg/myapp.git'
         dest: /var/www/myapp
     - name: Install npm packages
       command: npm install
       args:
         chdir: /var/www/myapp
 ```

 3. **Integration with GitLab CI/CD:**

 * The `deploy` stage of the pipeline runs this playbook using:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging.ini deploy.yml
   ```
 * We pass environment variables from GitLab to Ansible using `extra_vars`.

---

### 💡 Extra Points to Mention (if interviewer goes deeper)

* Handled **idempotency** with Ansible modules (`copy`, `service`, `template`)
* Used **Ansible Vault** to store secrets
* Organized roles using `ansible-galaxy init`
* Used dynamic inventories for AWS (optional if applicable)

**Kubernetes**
### 🔁 **Que 4 **Can you explain the basic components of a Kubernetes cluster (Control Plane & Node)? Also, describe a scenario where you deployed an app on Kubernetes — how did you write your manifest or Helm chart?

### ✅ **Answer**

### 🔹 **1. Basic Components of a Kubernetes Cluster**

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two primary components:

---

#### **A. Control Plane (Master Node)**

The **Control Plane** is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster, responsible for managing the overall state and orchestration.

**Key components:**

* **kube-apiserver**:
  Exposes the Kubernetes API; all control commands and cluster communications go through this.

* **etcd**:
  A consistent, distributed key-value store that saves all cluster state and configuration.

* **kube-scheduler**:
  Assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability, constraints, and policies.

* **kube-controller-manager**:
  Manages controllers like:

  * Node Controller: Handles node availability.
  * Replication Controller: Ensures the desired number of pods.
  * Endpoint Controller: Updates services and endpoints.

* **cloud-controller-manager (optional)**:
  Interacts with cloud-specific APIs (e.g., for managing load balancers, storage, etc.).

---

#### **B. Nodes (Worker Nodes)**

Nodes are the physical or virtual machines where application workloads (containers) run.

**Key components:**

* **kubelet**:
  Agent that runs on each node; ensures the pod containers are running as expected.

* **kube-proxy**:
  Maintains networking rules, enabling internal and external communication to services.

* **Container Runtime**:
  Executes containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

---

### 🔹 **2. Deployment Scenario: Web Application using Helm**

#### ✅ **Scenario:**

Deployed a full-stack web application on Kubernetes using a **Helm chart**, which consisted of:

* Frontend: **Nginx**
* Backend: **Node.js API**
* Database: **MongoDB**

---

#### **A. Helm Chart Structure**

```
my-webapp/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment-frontend.yaml
│   ├── service-frontend.yaml
│   ├── deployment-backend.yaml
│   ├── service-backend.yaml
│   ├── statefulset-mongodb.yaml
│   ├── service-mongodb.yaml
│   └── _helpers.tpl
```

---

#### **B. Sample: `deployment-frontend.yaml`**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "my-webapp.fullname" . }}-frontend
  labels:
    {{- include "my-webapp.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.frontend.replicaCount }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      {{- include "my-webapp.selectorLabels" . | nindent 6 }}
      app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        {{- include "my-webapp.selectorLabels" . | nindent 8 }}
        app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: "nginx:{{ .Values.frontend.imageTag }}"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

---

#### **C. Sample: `values.yaml`**

```yaml
frontend:
  replicaCount: 2
  imageTag: "latest"

backend:
  replicaCount: 2
  imageTag: "v1.0"

mongodb:
  storageSize: "5Gi"
  replicaCount: 1
```

---

#### **D. Deployment Steps**

1. **Define**: Created Helm templates for Deployment, Service, and StatefulSet.
2. **Parameterize**: Configured values in `values.yaml` for flexibility.
3. **Install**: Ran

   ```bash
   helm install my-release ./my-webapp
   ```

   to deploy the application.
4. **Upgrade/Rollback**: Used `helm upgrade` or `helm rollback` for lifecycle management.
