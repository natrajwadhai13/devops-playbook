Below are **REAL AZ-900 EXAM TRAP QUESTIONS** —
These are **wording traps**, **confusing options**, and **“almost correct” answers** that candidates usually fail on.
Each question includes **WHY the correct answer is correct** and **WHY others are wrong**.

---

# ⚠️ **AZ-900 Real Exam Trap Questions (With Explanations)**

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 1: Scalability vs Elasticity**

**Question:**
Azure automatically increases and decreases resources based on workload demand.
What cloud benefit is this?

A. Scalability
B. Elasticity
C. High availability
D. Fault tolerance

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B. Elasticity**

**Why?**

* **Elasticity** = automatic scale **out and in**
* **Scalability** = ability to scale, often manual or planned

❌ Many candidates choose **Scalability** → TRAP

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 2: Availability Set vs Availability Zone**

**Question:**
You need protection from **datacenter failure** within a region. What should you use?

A. Availability Set
B. Availability Zone
C. Resource Group
D. Geo-replication

✅ **Correct Answer:** **B. Availability Zone**

**Why?**

* Availability Zones = separate physical datacenters
* Availability Sets = racks & power (not full datacenter isolation)

❌ Availability Set is the most common wrong answer

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 3: Resource Group Region Confusion**

**Question:**
Can a resource group contain resources from different regions?

A. Yes
B. No

✅ **Correct Answer:** **A. Yes**

**Why?**

* Resource Group has a region
* Resources inside **can be in different regions**

❌ Many assume “same region only” → WRONG

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 4: Smallest Deployable Unit**

**Question:**
What is the smallest deployable component in Azure?

A. Subscription
B. Resource Group
C. Resource
D. Region

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C. Resource**

**Why?**

* VM, Storage Account, VNet = resources
* Everything else is a container

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 5: Storage Encryption**

**Question:**
Azure Storage encryption at rest is:

A. Optional
B. Enabled only for Premium
C. Enabled by default
D. Must be configured manually

✅ **Correct Answer:** **C. Enabled by default**

**Why?**

* Azure Storage **always encrypts data at rest**
* No configuration needed

---

## 🔴 **TRAP 6: Blob vs File Storage**

**Question:**
You need a shared file system that can be mounted on multiple VMs.
Which service should you use?
