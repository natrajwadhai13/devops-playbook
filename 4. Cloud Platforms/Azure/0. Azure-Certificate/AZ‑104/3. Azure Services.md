## When Should You Use Azure Cloud Shell?

As an IT Admin for Contoso Corporation, Azure Cloud Shell is useful when you need a quick and secure way to manage Azure resources from the command line without relying on your default administrative device.

### You can use Azure Cloud Shell to:
- Open a secure command-line session from any browser-based device  
- Interact with Azure resources without installing plug-ins or add-ons  
- Persist files between sessions for later use  
- Use either Bash or PowerShell to manage Azure resources  
- Edit files (such as scripts) using the Cloud Shell editor  

### You shouldn’t use Azure Cloud Shell if:
- You plan to run long-running scripts or keep a session open for more than 20 minutes, as the session may disconnect without warning  
- You require admin-level permissions (such as `sudo`) within Azure CLI or PowerShell  
- You need to install unsupported tools that require a custom VM or container  
- You require storage across multiple regions, as Cloud Shell supports storage in only one region  
- You need multiple concurrent sessions, since Cloud Shell allows only one active instance at a time  
```

**Que-**

**1. Which of these methods can you use to access Azure Cloud Shell from a computer running Windows 11?**

- Install Windows Subsystem for Linux and make an SSH connection to Azure.

- Make a Remote Desktop Protocol connection to Azure.

- Use the Microsoft Edge Browser to log into an Azure Subscription.

**Correct**

**2. You want to store a script that you constantly use for operations on Azure resources. This script needs to be rapidly available when you open a new Azure Cloud Shell session. Which of these procedures should you use?**

- Upload the script to your CloudDrive on an Azure Cloud Shell session.

**Correct**

- Create a new script and store it on an Azure Storage Blob.

- Use Cloud Shell editor to create and edit the script you want to use.

**3. You have a script stored on the Cloud Shell storage. You constantly use this script for resource management, but you need to perform small changes to it. Which of these solutions is the best way to handle the situation?**

- Download the script from the Azure Cloud Shell session, edit the script, and upload it back before using it.

- Push the script to GitHub and run it from the Azure Cloud Shell session.

- Use the Cloud Shell editor to make the necessary changes and save it directly on the CloudDrive.

**Correct**

# What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language.

## Features

- **Built-in help system** – Integrated help for cmdlets and concepts  
- **Pipeline** – Pass output of one command directly as input to another  
- **Aliases** – Short names for commonly used commands  
- **Object-based** – Operates on objects rather than plain text  
- **Cmdlets** – Lightweight, single-purpose commands  
- **Multiple command types** – Cmdlets, functions, scripts, aliases, executables  

---

# Exercise – Run Your First PowerShell Commands

Check PowerShell version details:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable
````

Check only the PowerShell version:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

---

# Locate Commands in PowerShell

A **cmdlet** (pronounced *command-let*) is a compiled command developed using .NET or .NET Core and executed within PowerShell. Thousands of cmdlets are available, and PowerShell provides tools to discover and understand them.

## Discovering Cmdlets

* **Get-Verb** – Lists approved verbs used in cmdlet names

### Core Discovery Cmdlets

* **Get-Command** – Finds available commands
* **Get-Help** – Displays help information for commands
* **Get-Member** – Shows properties and methods of objects

---

# Locate Commands Using Get-Command

### By Noun

Find commands related to aliases:

```powershell
Get-Command -Noun Alias*
```

### By Verb and Noun

Find `Get` commands related to aliases:

```powershell
Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun Alias*
```

---

# Exercise – Locate Commands

Find commands related to files:

```powershell
Get-Command -Noun File*
```

Find `Get` commands related to files:

```powershell
Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun File*
```

```
```


**Que -**

**a. What's a correct way to locate a command in PowerShell?**

1) Call Get-Command 'name of command'

**Correct**

2) Call Find 'name of command'

3) Call Locate 'name of command'


**b. How would you search for commands that deal with files?**

1) Call Get-Command -Verb File*

2) Call Get-Command -Noun File

3) Call Get-Command -Noun File*

**Correct**

## **3. Deploy Azure infrastructure by using JSON ARM templates**


Learning objectives

- Implement a JSON ARM template by using Visual Studio Code.
- Declare resources and add flexibility to your template by adding parameters and outputs.


### Introduction
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates enable you to implement **infrastructure as code (IaC)**. In this unit, you explore the structure of ARM templates, learn how to deploy them to Azure, and understand the purpose of the **resources** section.

---

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as code allows you to define and manage the infrastructure required for your application using code.

### Benefits of Infrastructure as Code
- Consistent configurations  
- Improved scalability  
- Faster deployments  
- Better traceability  

---

## What is an ARM Template?

An **ARM template** is a JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for Azure resources. It enables declarative deployment, meaning you describe *what* you want to deploy, and Azure handles *how* to deploy it.

---

## Benefits of Using ARM Templates

- Declarative syntax  
- Repeatable and consistent deployments  
- Version-controlled infrastructure  
- Integrated dependency management  
- Native support within Azure  

---

## ARM Template File Structure

ARM templates consist of the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|------|------------|
| **$schema** | Required. Defines the JSON schema location and structure for the template. The version depends on deployment scope and editor support. |
| **contentVersion** | Required. Specifies the version of the template (for example, `1.0.0.0`) to track significant changes. |
| **apiProfile** | Optional. Defines a collection of API versions for resource types to avoid specifying API versions per resource. |
| **parameters** | Optional. Defines values provided during deployment via parameter files, command line, or Azure portal. |
| **variables** | Optional. Stores values to simplify expressions within the template. |
| **functions** | Optional. Defines user-defined functions for reuse of complex expressions. |
| **resources** | Required. Specifies the Azure resources to deploy or update. |
| **outputs** | Optional. Returns values at the end of deployment. |

---

## Deploy an ARM Template to Azure

You can deploy ARM templates using the following methods:

- Deploy a **local template**  
- Deploy a **linked template**  
- Deploy through a **continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline**
