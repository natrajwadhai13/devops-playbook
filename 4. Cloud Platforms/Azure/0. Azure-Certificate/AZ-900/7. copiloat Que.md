## **🌐 AZ‑900 Master Cheat Sheet (Cloud + Architecture + Governance)**

## 1️⃣ Cloud Concepts (25–30%)
- **Cloud computing:** On‑demand delivery of services via internet  
- **Shared responsibility:** Provider → infra; Customer → data & access  
- **Cloud models:**  
  - Public → cost‑effective, scalable (startups)  
  - Private → compliance, control (banks)  
  - Hybrid → mix on‑prem + cloud (migration flexibility)  
  - Community → shared compliance needs (gov agencies)  
- **Consumption model:** Pay only for usage  
- **Pricing models:** Pay‑as‑you‑go, Reserved instances, Spot pricing  
- **Serverless:** Event‑driven, infra abstracted  
- **Benefits:** High availability, Scalability, Reliability, Predictability, Security, Governance, Manageability  
- **Service types:**  
  - IaaS → VMs, storage, networking  
  - PaaS → App hosting, no OS/runtime mgmt  
  - SaaS → Ready‑to‑use apps (Office 365, Gmail)

## 2️⃣ Azure Architecture & Services (35–40%)

### Core Architecture
- **Regions:** Group of datacenters in geography  
- **Region pairs:** Disaster recovery redundancy  
- **Sovereign regions:** Compliance‑specific (China, Gov)  
- **Availability zones:** Physically separate datacenters for HA  

### Resource Organization
- **Hierarchy:** Mgmt groups → Subscriptions → Resource groups → Resources  
- **Resource group:** Logical container for related resources  

### Compute
- **VMs:** Full OS/app control  
- **Containers:** Lightweight, portable workloads  
- **Functions:** Event‑driven, serverless code  
- **VM Scale Sets:** Auto scaling identical VMs

### Storage
- **Blob storage:** Unstructured data  
- **Tiers:** Hot (frequent), Cool (infrequent), Archive (lowest cost, highest latency)  
- **Redundancy:** LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA‑GRS  
- **Tools:**  
  - AzCopy → CLI transfers  
  - Storage Explorer → GUI mgmt  
  - File Sync → On‑prem ↔ Azure sync  
  - Migrate → Workload migration  
  - Data Box → Physical devices for bulk transfer  

### Identity & Security
- **Entra ID:** Identity & access mgmt  
- **Entra Domain Services:** Managed domain (LDAP, Kerberos)  
- **Auth methods:** SSO, MFA, Passwordless  
- **External identities:** Secure partner/vendor access  
- **Conditional Access:** Policy enforcement by conditions  
- **RBAC:** Role‑based access control  
- **Zero Trust:** Verify every request  
- **Defense‑in‑depth:** Layered security  
- **Defender for Cloud:** Threat protection & recommendations

## 3️⃣ Azure Management & Governance (30–35%)

### Cost Management
- **Cost factors:** Resource type, usage, region  
- **Estimate costs:** Azure Pricing Calculator  
- **Track spending:** Azure Cost Management  
- **Resource tags:** Organize for cost tracking  

### Governance & Compliance
- **Microsoft Purview:** Unified data governance  
- **Azure Policy:** Enforce compliance rules  
- **Resource Locks:** Prevent accidental deletion/modification  

### Resource Management & Deployment
- **Portal:** Web‑based GUI  
- **Cloud Shell:** Browser‑based shell
