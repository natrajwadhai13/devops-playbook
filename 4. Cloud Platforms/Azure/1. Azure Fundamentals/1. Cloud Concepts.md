# Basics of Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud ?

In simpler terms, imagine the cloud as a vast, virtual space where you can store files, run software, and access various services over the internet. 

It's like having a powerful computer somewhere out there on the web that you can use for tasks without needing to own or physically manage the hardware. This allows users to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

## What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources, applications, and storage provided by either third-party service providers (public cloud) or their own organization (private cloud) through the internet. These services are hosted in data centers located around the world.

In essence, cloud computing can involve both third-party providers (public cloud) and an organization's internal resources (private cloud). The distinction lies in whether the computing resources are shared among multiple customers (public cloud) or dedicated to a single organization (private cloud). The flexibility of cloud computing allows organizations to choose the deployment model that best aligns with their needs and requirements.

## Public Cloud:

**Who Uses It:** Everyone, like individuals, businesses, and organizations.

**What It's Like:** Imagine a giant, shared computer space on the internet. It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.

**Example:** Think of Google Drive or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Private Cloud:

**Who Uses It:** One specific organization or business.

**What It's Like:** Picture having your own personal, private computer space. It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.

**Example:** A company using its own server for all its digital needs.

## Hybrid Cloud:

**Who Uses It:** A mix of everyone, depending on needs.

**What It's Like:** It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too. 

**Example:** A business storing sensitive data in its private space but using the public cloud for extra storage or specific tasks.

### In a Nutshell:

**Public Cloud:** Shared digital space for everyone.

**Private Cloud:** Your own exclusive digital space.

**Hybrid Cloud:** Using both your private space and the shared online space when needed.

# Vocabulary in Cloud Computing

## Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.

## Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

## Regions

Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones

Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

## Elasticity

Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.

## Agility

Agility is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.

## High Availability

High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

# Exploring Regions and Availability Zones in Azure

## Regions in Azure

Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft, and it is globally distributed across multiple geographic locations known as regions. Each Azure region is a set of data centers deployed within a defined geographic area, and it is designed to provide low-latency access to Azure services for users and applications in that region.

### Key Points about Azure Regions:

- **Global Presence:** Azure has a vast global presence with data centers strategically located around the world.
  
- **Region Pairing:** Azure regions are often paired for data redundancy and resiliency. In the event of a regional failure, paired regions can help ensure continuity.

- **Compliance and Data Residency:** Organizations can choose specific regions to comply with data residency requirements and regulations.

## Availability Zones in Azure

Azure Availability Zones are part of Azure's high-availability architecture, providing redundancy and resiliency for applications and data. Each Azure region is divided into multiple Availability Zones, which are essentially unique physical locations with independent power, cooling, and networking.

### Key Points about Azure Availability Zones:

- **High Availability:** By distributing resources across Availability Zones, Azure ensures that applications remain available even in the face of localized failures, such as hardware or network failures.

- **Fault Isolation:** Availability Zones are designed to be isolated from one another, meaning a failure in one zone does not impact the availability of resources in other zones.

- **Multi-Data Center Architectures:** Availability Zones are essential for designing and deploying multi-data center architectures in Azure.

## How to Choose Regions and Availability Zones

When deploying resources in Azure, it's crucial to consider factors such as:

- **Proximity to Users:** Choose a region that is geographically close to your users to minimize latency.

- **Compliance Requirements:** Ensure that the chosen region complies with regulatory and data residency requirements.

- **High Availability Needs:** If high availability is a priority, distribute resources across multiple Availability Zones within a region.

- **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Leverage region pairing for effective disaster recovery planning.

---

### There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:

Billing boundary: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.

Access control boundary: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.


Important facts about management groups:

- 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.

- A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.

- Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.
