# Describe Azure compute and networking services

Introduction - This module introduces you to the compute and networking services of Azure. You learn about three of the compute options (virtual machines, containers, and Azure functions). You also learn about some of the networking features, such as Azure virtual networks, Azure DNS, and Azure ExpressRoute.


## Learning objectives:

Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions.

Describe virtual machine options, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, virtual machine availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop.

Describe resources required for virtual machines.

Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines.

Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.

Define public and private endpoints.

#### Virtual machine scale sets:

A virtual machine scale set is a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. You can use scale sets to support true autoscale for your applications, and to simplify the management of your VM deployments. Scale sets are designed to support large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.

#### Virtual machine availability sets:

An availability set is a logical grouping capability for isolating VM resources from each other when they are deployed. Azure ensures that the VMs you place within an availability set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches. This approach ensures that if a hardware or software failure occurs, only a subset of your VMs are impacted and your overall solution remains available and operational.

Availability sets accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.

Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.

Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).

## Azure virtual desktop

**Quick Answer:**  
Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is a **cloud-based desktop and app virtualization service** that lets you securely deliver Windows desktops and applications from Azure to any device, anywhere.  

---

# 📘 Short Notes: Azure Virtual Desktop (AZ-900)

## 🔹 What is Azure Virtual Desktop?
- AVD provides **full Windows 11/10 or Windows Server desktops** hosted in Azure.  
- Users can access desktops and apps remotely via the internet.  
- Supports **multi-session Windows 10/11**, allowing multiple users to share the same VM.  
- Integrates with **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** and **Microsoft 365 Apps** for enterprise use.  

---

## 🔹 Key Features
- **Remote Access:** Securely access desktops and apps from anywhere, on any device.  
- **Scalability:** Use **host pools** to manage multiple session hosts for large deployments.  
- **Flexibility:** Deliver full desktops or individual apps (RemoteApp).  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for the resources you use; scale up/down based on demand.  
- **Security:** Centralized management, MFA, Conditional Access, and compliance policies.  
- **Compatibility:** Run Win32, MSIX, and Appx applications in the cloud.

## 📊 Benefits for Organizations
| Benefit                  | Explanation |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Work from Anywhere**    | Employees can securely access desktops/apps on laptops, tablets, or phones. |
| **Reduced IT Overhead**   | No need to maintain physical desktops; centralized updates and patching. |
| **Business Continuity**   | Resources can be replicated across regions for disaster recovery. |
| **Integration**           | Works seamlessly with Microsoft 365 and Teams optimization. |
| **Cost Control**          | Consumption-based pricing; scale resources dynamically. |

---

## 🔹 Exam Tips (AZ-900)
- AVD = **Desktop & app virtualization service** in Azure.  
- Supports **multi-session Windows 10/11** (unique to Azure).  
- Uses **host pools, workspaces, and application groups** for deployment.  
- Best for **remote work, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and secure access**.  
- Different from just running a VM — it’s a **managed virtualization platform**.
