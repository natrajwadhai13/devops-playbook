# 💰 **Azure Pricing, SLAs & Cost Management**

*(Simple • Structured • Exam + Practical Ready)*

---

## 1️⃣ **Azure Pricing (How Azure Charges You)**

### ☁️ What is Azure Pricing?

Azure follows a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model where you pay **only for what you use** on **Microsoft Azure**.

---

### 🔹 Pricing Factors

Azure cost depends on:

* **Service type** (VM, Storage, Database, etc.)
* **Usage time** (per second / per hour)
* **Region** (prices vary by region)
* **Performance tier** (Standard / Premium)
* **Data transfer** (Outbound traffic costs money)

📌 **Inbound data is FREE**, outbound is chargeable.

---

### 🔹 Common Pricing Models

| Model                    | Meaning                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Pay-as-you-go (OpEx)** | Pay only for actual usage              |
| **Reserved Instances**   | 1 or 3 year commitment (cheaper)       |
| **Spot Pricing**         | Unused capacity (cheap, interruptible) |
| **Free Tier**            | Limited free usage                     |

---

### 🔹 Azure Pricing Tools

* **Azure Pricing Calculator** → Estimate cost **before** deployment
* **Azure TCO Calculator** → Compare on-prem vs Azure cost

---

## 2️⃣ **SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**

### 📄 What is an SLA?

An **SLA** is a **guarantee** from Azure about **service availability** and **uptime**.

> Example: 99.9% availability

---

### 🔹 Why SLAs Matter?

* Defines expected uptime
* Determines service reliability
* Used to claim **service credits** if Azure fails

---

### 🔹 Common Azure SLA Percentages

| Availability | Downtime per Month (Approx.) |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **99%**      | ~7.2 hours                   |
| **99.9%**    | ~43 minutes                  |
| **99.99%**   | ~4 minutes                   |
| **99.999%**  | ~26 seconds                  |

📌 Higher SLA = higher cost.

---

### 🔹 SLA Examples

* **Single VM** → ~99.9%
* **VMs in Availability Set** → ~99.95%
* **VMs in Availability Zones** → ~99.99%

📌 **Design affects SLA**, not just service.

---

### 🔹 Composite SLA (EXAM TRAP ⚠️)

If your solution uses **multiple services**, total SLA is **lower**.

**Example**

```
VM SLA = 99.9%
Storage SLA = 99.9%

Combined SLA = 99.9% × 99.9% = 99.8%
```

---

### 🔹 Service Credits

* If Azure fails to meet SLA
* Microsoft provides **billing credits**
* Credits ≠ automatic → must claim

---

## 3️⃣ **Cost Management in Azure**

### 💵 What is Azure Cost Management?

Azure Cost Management helps you:

* Monitor spending
* Control budgets
* Optimize cloud costs

---

### 🔹 Key Cost Management Features

#### 📊 Cost Analysis

* View usage & spending
* Filter by:

  * Subscription
  * Resource group
  * Service
  * Time period

#### 💰 Budgets

* Set spending limits
* Get alerts when threshold is reached

#### 🏷️ Tags

* Label resources (e.g., `Project=HR`)
* Track costs per team/project

---

### 🔹 Azure Advisor (Cost Optimization)

Azure Advisor recommends:

* Resize underutilized VMs
* Delete unused resources
* Purchase Reserved Instances

📌 **Advisor recommends, Policy enforces** (exam trap).

---

### 🔹 Ways to Reduce Azure Costs

* Shut down unused VMs
* Use **Reserved Instances**
* Right-size VMs
* Use Auto-scaling
* Monitor via Cost Management
* Apply tags

---

## 4️⃣ **Pricing vs Cost Management vs SLA (Comparison)**

| Topic               | Purpose                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Pricing**         | How Azure charges        |
| **Cost Management** | Control & optimize spend |
| **SLA**             | Availability guarantee   |

---

## 5️⃣ **AZ-900 Exam Traps (VERY IMPORTANT)**

* Azure uses **OpEx**, not CapEx
* Inbound data is free
* SLA credits are **not automatic**
* Composite SLA is **lower than individual SLAs**
* Advisor ≠ Policy
* Higher SLA = higher cost

---

## 6️⃣ **One-Line Final Revision**

* **Pricing** → Pay for what you use
* **SLA** → Availability guarantee
* **Cost Management** → Track & control spend
* **Advisor** → Recommendations
* **Policy** → Enforcement
