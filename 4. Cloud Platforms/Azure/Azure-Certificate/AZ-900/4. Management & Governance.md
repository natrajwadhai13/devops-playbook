## Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure

Azure shifts development costs from the capital expense (CapEx) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx) of renting infrastructure as you need it, whether it’s compute, storage, networking, and so on.

That OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors. Some of the impacting factors are:

Resource type
Consumption
Maintenance
Geography
Subscription type
Azure Marketplace

### Geography

When you provision most resources in Azure, you need to define a region where the resource deploys. Azure infrastructure is distributed globally, which enables you to deploy your services centrally or closest to your customers, or something in between. With this global deployment comes global pricing differences. The cost of power, labor, taxes, and fees vary depending on the location. Due to these variations, Azure resources can differ in costs to deploy depending on the region.

Network traffic is also impacted based on geography. For example, it’s less expensive to move information within Europe than to move information from Europe to Asia or South America.


## Explore the pricing calculator

## Exercise - Estimate workload costs by using the Pricing calculator

## Describe the Microsoft Cost Management tool

What is Cost Management?

Cost Management provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources.

Cost analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs. Using cost analysis, you can quickly view the total cost in a variety of different ways, including by billing cycle, region, resource, and so on.

Cost alerts: 

  Budget alerts: Budget alerts notify you when spending, based on usage or cost, reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget. Cost Management budgets are created using the Azure portal or the Azure Consumption API.

  Credit alerts: Credit alerts notify you when your Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed. Monetary commitments are for organizations with Enterprise Agreements (EAs). Credit alerts are generated automatically at 90% and at 100% of your Azure credit balance. Whenever an alert is generated, it's reflected in cost alerts, and in the email sent to the account owners.

  Department spending quota alerts.: Department spending quota alerts notify you when department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota. Spending quotas are configured in the EA portal. Whenever a threshold is met, it generates an email to department owners, and appears in cost alerts. For example, 50 percent or 75 percent of the quota.

  Budgets: A budget is where you set a spending limit for Azure. You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria. When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert. When the budget hits the budget alert level, it will trigger a budget alert that shows up in the cost alerts area. If configured, budget alerts will also send an email notification that a budget alert threshold has been triggered.

A more advanced use of budgets enables budget conditions to trigger automation that suspends or otherwise modifies resources once the trigger condition has occurred.


## Describe the purpose of tags

# **Azure virtual networking**

Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. You can think of an Azure network as an extension of your on-premises network with resources that link other Azure resources.

Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:

- Isolation and segmentation
- Internet communications
- Communicate between Azure resources
- Communicate with on-premises resources
- Route network traffic
- Filter network traffic
- Connect virtual networks

---

# 📘 Short Notes: Azure Virtual Networking (AZ-900)

## 🔹 1. Isolation and Segmentation
- **Virtual Network (VNet):**  
  - A logically isolated network in Azure.  
  - Provides segmentation of resources (like VMs, databases, apps).  
- **Subnets:**  
  - Divide VNets into smaller segments for better management and security.  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs):**  
  - Control inbound/outbound traffic at subnet or NIC level.  

---

## 🔹 2. Internet Communications
- VNets can connect to the internet by default.  
- Public IP addresses allow resources to be accessible externally.  
- Azure Firewall or NSGs can restrict/control internet traffic.  

---

## 🔹 3. Communicate Between Azure Resources
- **Private IPs:** Resources in the same VNet communicate securely.  
- **Service Endpoints / Private Link:** Provide secure access to Azure services (e.g., Storage, SQL) without exposing them to the public internet.  

---

## 🔹 4. Communicate with On-Premises Resources
- **VPN Gateway:** Secure site-to-site or point-to-site connectivity.  
- **ExpressRoute:** Private, dedicated connection between on-premises and Azure (not over public internet).  
- **Hybrid Networking:** Combines VNets with on-premises networks for seamless integration.  

---

## 🔹 5. Route Network Traffic
- **System Routes:** Automatically created by Azure (e.g., within VNets, to internet).  
- **User-Defined Routes (UDRs):** Custom routing rules to direct traffic through appliances like firewalls.  
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Used with ExpressRoute/VPN for dynamic routing.  

---

## 🔹 6. Filter Network Traffic
- **NSGs (Network Security Groups):** Allow/deny rules for traffic.  
- **Azure Firewall:** Centralized, managed firewall with logging and threat intelligence.  
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects web apps from common attacks (SQL injection, XSS).  

---

## 🔹 7. Connect Virtual Networks
- **VNet Peering:** Connects VNets across regions or subscriptions.  
  - Low-latency, high-bandwidth connection.  
  - Traffic stays on Microsoft backbone (not public internet).  
- **Hub-and-Spoke Model:** Central hub VNet connects multiple spoke VNets for better management.  

---

## 🎯 Exam Tips (AZ-900)
- **VNet = isolation + segmentation**.  
- **VPN Gateway vs ExpressRoute:** VPN = internet-based, ExpressRoute = private dedicated.  
- **NSGs vs Azure Firewall:** NSGs = basic filtering, Firewall = advanced centralized protection.  
- **VNet Peering:** Connect VNets securely across regions.  
- **Private Link:** Secure access to Azure services without public exposure.

## 🔐 What is Authentication?

**Authentication** verifies the **identity** of a user, service, or device.
Think of it like showing an **ID**—it proves *who you are*, not *what you’re allowed to do*.

Azure supports multiple authentication methods through **Microsoft Entra ID**.

---

## 🔑 Azure Authentication Methods (Exam Focus)

### 1️⃣ Password-based Authentication

* Username + password
* ✔ Easy to use
* ❌ Least secure (phishing, reuse)

👉 **Security**: Low | **Convenience**: High

---

### 2️⃣ Single Sign-On (SSO)

#### 🔹 What is SSO?

**Single Sign-On** lets users sign in **once** and access **multiple applications**.

### ⭐ Benefits

* One username & password
* Better user experience
* Centralized identity management

👉 **Example**: Sign in once → access Email, Azure Portal, Office 365

---

### 3️⃣ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### 🔹 What is MFA?

Requires **two or more** authentication factors:

* Something you **know** (password)
* Something you **have** (phone, token)
* Something you **are** (biometric)

### ⭐ Benefits

* Strong protection against compromised passwords

---

### 🔐 Microsoft Entra MFA

**Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication** adds extra verification such as:

* Phone call
* SMS
* Mobile app notification

👉 **Common exam line**: *MFA = extra layer of security*

---

### 4️⃣ Passwordless Authentication

#### 🔹 What is Passwordless?

Authentication **without using a password**, offering **high security + high convenience**.

### ⭐ Why Passwordless?

* No passwords to steal or forget
* Resistant to phishing

---

## 🧩 Passwordless Methods in Azure

### 🔹 Windows Hello for Business

* Biometric or PIN-based login
* Uses device-bound credentials
* Best for Windows devices

---

### 🔹 Microsoft Authenticator App

* Phone-based sign-in approval
* Push notifications or biometrics

---

### 🔹 FIDO2 Security Keys

* Hardware-based authentication
* USB / NFC / Bluetooth keys
* Strongest phishing-resistant option

---

## 📊 Security vs Convenience (Exam Concept)

| Method       | Security  | Convenience |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| Password     | Low       | High        |
| SSO          | Medium    | Very High   |
| MFA          | High      | Medium      |
| Passwordless | Very High | High        |

---

## ✅ AZ-900 Exam Key Takeaways

* Authentication = **who you are**
* **SSO** = one login, many apps
* **MFA** = 2+ verification factors

## 🧠 **AZ-900 Shorts Notes – Azure Conditional Access**

![Image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/media/plan-conditional-access/conditional-access-overview-how-it-works.png)

![Image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/media/common-conditional-access-media/conditional-access-signal-decision-enforcement.png)

---

## 🔐 What is Conditional Access?

**Conditional Access** is a policy-based tool in **Microsoft Entra ID** that **allows or denies access** to resources based on **identity signals**.

👉 In simple words:
**IF** certain conditions are met → **THEN** allow, block, or require extra verification.

---

## 📊 Identity Signals Used

Conditional Access evaluates signals such as:

* 👤 **Who** the user is (role, group)
* 🌍 **Where** the user is (location/IP)
* 💻 **Which device** is used (managed/unmanaged)
* 📱 **Which app** is being accessed
* ⚠ **Risk level** of sign-in

---

## 🔁 How Conditional Access Works (Exam Flow)

**Signal → Decision → Enforcement**

1️⃣ **Signal collected**

* User location, device, app, risk

2️⃣ **Decision made**

* Allow access
* Block access
* Require MFA

3️⃣ **Enforcement**

* Grant access
* Challenge for MFA
* Deny access

---

## 🔐 Granular MFA Experience

* ✅ No MFA from **trusted location**
* ⚠ MFA required from **unusual or risky location**
* ❌ Access blocked from **high-risk sources**

👉 Improves **security without hurting productivity**

---

## 🎯 When to Use Conditional Access

### ✅ Common Use Cases

* Require **MFA for admins**, not normal users
* Require MFA when accessing from **outside corporate network**
* Allow access only from **approved client apps**
* Require **managed/compliant devices**
* Block access from **unknown or risky locations**

---

## 🧠 Why IT Admins Use Conditional Access

* Protect organization assets
* Reduce unauthorized access
* Enable secure remote work
* Apply **context-aware security**

---

## 📌 AZ-900 Key Takeaways

* Conditional Access = **IF–THEN security**
* Based on **signals**
* Enforces **Allow / Block / MFA**
* MFA is **conditional**, not always forced
* Very common **scenario-based exam questions**

## Describe Azure role-based access control

👉 [refer notes Azure officil document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/6-role-based-access-control)

## 🧠 **AZ-900 Shorts Notes – Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

![Image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/media/scope-overview/rbac-scope-no-label.png)

![Image](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b7501f6f-0321-4752-b24d-830a9dd287a0.webp)

---

## 🔐 What is Azure RBAC?

**Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is an authorization system in **Microsoft Azure** that helps you **control who can do what** on **which resources**.

It follows the **principle of least privilege**:

> Give users **only the access they need**, nothing more.

---

## 🧩 Why Azure RBAC?

* Multiple teams & resources = complex permissions
* Avoid managing permissions **user-by-user**
* Assign **roles** once → access applies automatically

---

## 🎭 Roles in Azure RBAC

A **role** is a collection of permissions.

### 🔹 Built-in Roles (Examples)

* **Owner** → Full access + can assign roles
* **Contributor** → Create & manage resources
* **Reader** → View-only access

👉 You can also create **custom roles**.

---

## 👥 Role Assignment

* Assign roles to:

  * Users
  * Groups
  * Service principals
  * Managed identities
* New users added to a group **automatically inherit access**

---

## 📍 What is a Scope?

A **scope** defines **where** the role applies.

### 🔹 RBAC Scopes

* Management Group
* Subscription
* Resource Group
* Individual Resource

---

## 🌳 RBAC Hierarchy & Inheritance

RBAC is **hierarchical**:

* Permissions assigned at a **parent scope** apply to **child scopes**

### 🧠 Examples

* Owner at **Management Group** → access to all subscriptions
* Reader at **Subscription** → read access to all resource groups & resources

---

## ⚙ How Azure RBAC is Enforced

* Enforced through **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
* Applies to actions via:

  * Azure Portal
  * Azure CLI
  * Azure PowerShell
  * Azure Cloud Shell
* ❌ Does **not** control:

  * Application-level access
  * Data inside the app (handled by app logic)

---

## ✅ Allow Model

* Azure RBAC uses an **allow-only model**
* Permissions are **additive**
* Multiple roles = **combined permissions**

👉 Example:

* Reader role + Contributor role = **Read + Write**

---

## 📊 Quick Summary (Exam Ready)

| Concept     | Key Point                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| RBAC        | Controls access to Azure resources |
| Role        | Set of permissions                 |
| Scope       | Where access applies               |
| Inheritance | Parent → child                     |
| Enforcement | Via Azure Resource Manager         |
| Model       | Allow-based (additive)             |

---

## ✅ AZ-900 Exam Key Takeaways

* RBAC = **Authorization**, not authentication
* Least privilege is core concept
* Roles + Scopes = Access control
* Permissions **inherit downward**
* Very common **scenario-based questions**

## Describe Zero Trust model

👉 [refer notes Azure officil document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/7-describe-zero-trust-model)

## 🧠 **AZ-900 Shorts Notes – Zero Trust Model**

![Image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230315181624/Zero-Trust-Security-Model.png)

![Image](https://wesecureapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zero-Trust-Principles-1024x490.jpg)

---

## 🔐 What is the Zero Trust Model?

**Zero Trust** is a security model that **assumes breach by default** and **trusts no request automatically**, even if it comes from inside the network.

👉 In simple words:
**“Never trust, always verify.”**

Microsoft strongly recommends Zero Trust for modern cloud environments like **Microsoft Azure**.

---

## 🌍 Why Zero Trust is Needed

Modern IT environments are:

* Cloud-based
* Mobile & remote
* Multi-device & multi-location

Traditional perimeter security (VPN = trusted) **no longer works**.

---

## 🧩 Zero Trust Core Principles (Exam-Focused)

### 1️⃣ Verify Explicitly

* Always authenticate & authorize
* Use all signals:

  * User identity
  * Location
  * Device health
  * Risk level
* Strong identity via **Microsoft Entra ID**

---

### 2️⃣ Use Least Privilege Access

* Give **minimum access required**
* Techniques:

  * Just-In-Time (JIT)
  * Just-Enough-Access (JEA)
  * Risk-based adaptive policies
* Reduce attack surface

---

### 3️⃣ Assume Breach

* Act as if attackers are already inside
* Limit **blast radius**
* Segment access
* Use:

  * End-to-end encryption
  * Continuous monitoring
  * Threat analytics

---

## 🔄 Traditional Security vs Zero Trust

| Traditional Model      | Zero Trust Model         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Trust internal network | Trust no one             |
| VPN = safe             | Always authenticate      |
| Location-based access  | Identity-based access    |
| Perimeter focused      | Identity + device + data |

---

## 🧠 Key Shift in Zero Trust

* Access is based on **identity**, not **network location**
* Every request is:

  * Verified
  * Evaluated
  * Logged

---

## ✅ AZ-900 Exam Key Takeaways

* Zero Trust = **assume breach**
* Always **verify explicitly**
* Apply **least privilege**
* Location ≠ trust
* Identity is the **new security perimeter**
