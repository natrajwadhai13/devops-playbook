# **2. What is Software Testing?**

Process of identifying defects and ensuring the product meets requirements.

---

# **3. What is Quality Assurance (QA)?**

Ensures correct **process** is followed during development.

---

# **4. Difference Between QA and QC.**

QA → Process-oriented,
QC → Product-oriented.

---

# **5. What is SDLC?**

Phases: Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.

---

# **6. What is STLC?**

Requirement analysis → Test planning → Test design → Test execution → Defect reporting → Test closure.

---

# **7. What is a Test Case?**

Detailed steps + inputs + expected result to validate functionality.

---

# **8. What is a Test Scenario?**

High-level action to test a feature.
Example: *Verify login functionality.*

---

# **9. Test Case vs Test Scenario.**

Scenario = What to test
Test Case = How to test

---

# **10. What is Smoke Testing?**

Basic testing to check build stability.

---

# **11. What is Sanity Testing?**

Focused testing after a build or bug fix to check specific functionality.

---

# **12. What is Regression Testing?**

Retesting existing features after new changes.

---

# **13. What is Functional Testing?**

Validating application functionality as per requirements.

---

# **14. What is Non-Functional Testing?**

Performance, security, usability, reliability testing.

---

# **15. What is UAT?**

User Acceptance Testing—done by client to check business flow.

---

# **16. What is Severity & Priority?**

Severity = Impact
Priority = Urgency to fix

---

# **17. Explain Defect Life Cycle.**

New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed.

---

# **18. Difference Between Error, Defect, Bug.**

Error = Developer mistake
Defect = Found by tester
Bug = Accepted defect

---

# **19. Verification vs Validation.**

Verification = Process check
Validation = Actual product testing

---

# **26. How do you log a bug in JIRA?**

Provide steps, expected result, actual result, evidence (screenshots), severity, priority.

---

# **27. What if you find a bug on release day?**
