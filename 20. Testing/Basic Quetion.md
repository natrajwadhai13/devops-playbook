---

## **4. Difference between QA and QC**

* **QA** = Process oriented
* **QC** = Product oriented

A set of steps to validate a functionality.

Example fields:

* Test case ID
* Steps
* Expected result
* Actual result

---

## **8. What is a Test Scenario?**

High-level action to test a feature.

---

## **16. What is Severity & Priority?**

* **Severity** = Impact of defect

Example:
Login not working → **Severity High, Priority High**

---

## **17. What is Defect Life Cycle?**

New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed

---

## **18. What is the Difference Between Bug, Error, and Defect?**

* **Error** → Developer mistake
* **Defect** → Found by tester
* **Bug** → Accepted defect

---

## **19. What is Verification vs Validation?**

* **Verification**: Are we building the product *right*? (process check)
* **Validation**: Are we building the *right* product? (actual testing)

---

## **20. What is Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)?**

Document that maps requirements → test cases.

---

## **21. What is Exploratory Testing?**

Testing without any test cases; based on experience.

---

## **22. What is Ad-hoc Testing?**

Unstructured testing done randomly.

---

## **23. What is Black Box Testing?**

Testing without knowing internal code.

---

## **24. What is White Box Testing?**

Testing with code knowledge (developer does).

---

## **25. What documents do you prepare as a tester?**

* Test Plan
* Test Scenarios
* Test Cases

* Environment
* Severity/Priority

---

## **27. What will you do if you find a bug on the last day of release?**

* Immediately report to team
* Discuss severity/priority
* Decision by manager & client

---

## **28. What if developer says “This is not a bug”?**

* Show requirement document
* Provide steps & evidence
* If needed → escalate to BA/lead

---

## **29. What is API testing? (Basic Answer)**

Testing request-response using tools like Postman.

---

## **30. What is your daily routine in Agile?**

* Daily standup
* Test scenario creation
* Test execution
* Bug reporting
* Test summary update

---
