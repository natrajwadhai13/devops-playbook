---

## **20. What is Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)?**

Document that maps requirements → test cases.

---

## **21. What is Exploratory Testing?**

Testing without any test cases; based on experience.

---

## **22. What is Ad-hoc Testing?**

Unstructured testing done randomly.

---

## **23. What is Black Box Testing?**

Testing without knowing internal code.

---

## **24. What is White Box Testing?**

Testing with code knowledge (developer does).

---

## **25. What documents do you prepare as a tester?**

* Test Plan
* Test Scenarios
* Test Cases
* RTM
* Defect Reports
* Test Summary Report

---

## **26. How do you log a bug in JIRA?**

* Steps to reproduce
* Expected result
* Actual result
* Screenshots
* Environment
* Severity/Priority

---

## **27. What will you do if you find a bug on the last day of release?**

* Immediately report to team
* Discuss severity/priority
* Decision by manager & client

---

## **28. What if developer says “This is not a bug”?**

* Show requirement document
* Provide steps & evidence
* If needed → escalate to BA/lead

---

## **29. What is API testing? (Basic Answer)**

Testing request-response using tools like Postman.

---

## **30. What is your daily routine in Agile?**

* Daily standup
* Test scenario creation
* Test execution
