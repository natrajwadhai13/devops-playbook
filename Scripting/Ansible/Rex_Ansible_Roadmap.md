Here’s a **clear and concise roadmap for Rex-Ansible**, tailored to your DevOps background and aligned with your current use at Infosys (UBS, Credit Suisse), where **Rex-Ansible** is being used alongside tools like GSNOW, GitLab, Axway, and ECMS.

---

## 🧭 **Rex-Ansible Roadmap (4 Weeks)**

🔧 **Goal**: Master Rex-Ansible to automate Linux/infra tasks and integrate it into enterprise workflows (with GitLab, ECMS, Autosys, etc.)

---

### 🔰 **Week 1: Foundation & Environment Setup**

#### 🎯 Outcomes:

* Understand what Rex-Ansible is
* Get the environment ready

#### Topics:

* What is Rex-Ansible?
  → Hybrid automation combining **Rex (Remote Execution)** with **Ansible Playbooks**
  → Popular in enterprise environments like UBS, Infosys due to control + legacy support
* Architecture: Rex layer + Ansible backend
* Install Rex-Ansible environment
* SSH key setup for remote execution
* Rex job structure vs Ansible playbooks

#### Hands-on:

* Create a basic rex job to execute shell command on a remote Linux machine
* Ansible `ping` via rex
* Integrate GitLab repo with rex job

---

### ⚙️ **Week 2: Writing Playbooks + Rex Scripts**

#### 🎯 Outcomes:

* Use Rex to run Ansible playbooks
* Parameterized automation

#### Topics:

* Rex job YAML format vs native Ansible playbooks
* Using variables in Rex-Ansible
* Executing shell scripts + inline Bash in Rex
* Host groups and inventory (rex-style)
* Use `rex run` and `rex list` effectively

#### Hands-on:

* Deploy Apache/NGINX using Rex-Ansible playbook
* Create a playbook to patch multiple servers
* Run job with inputs (environment, hostname)

---

### ☁️ **Week 3: Enterprise Integration & Security**

#### 🎯 Outcomes:

* Integrate with Infra, ECMS, GitLab CI
* Secure automation using Vault/Secrets

#### Topics:

* GitLab + Rex CI/CD integration (pipeline triggers for Rex jobs)
* Logging and job output storage in ECMS or shared NFS
* Use secrets securely with **Ansible Vault** or encrypted vars in Rex
* Notifications via SMTP or SNOW integration

#### Hands-on:

* Automate git-pulled config deployment via Rex
* Push job logs to ECMS directory
* Secure secrets using vault + passphrase vars
* Trigger job via GitLab webhook or API

---

### 🚀 **Week 4: Real-World Use Cases + Best Practices**

#### 🎯 Outcomes:

* Deploy end-to-end enterprise-grade Rex-Ansible project
* Follow structure and compliance

#### Project Example:

* Deploy and configure Tomcat with SSL on multiple RedHat servers using Rex-Ansible
* Steps:

  * Provision servers
  * Install packages
  * Copy configs
  * Set up monitoring (Nagios client or Prometheus exporter)
  * Log into ECMS
  * Send job result to mail

#### Best Practices:

* Use naming convention: `rex-ansible-{env}-{component}`
* Central inventory and var reuse
* Break roles into reusable playbooks
* Ensure audit logs are captured

## 📘 Resources (Most will be internal/enterprise due to proprietary use)

| Type          | Resource                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal Wiki | Check UBS/Infosys internal Confluence or ECMS for Rex-Ansible SOPs                             |
| GitLab        | Look for sample Rex YAML in GitLab repos                                                       |
| Tools         | GSNOW, ECMS, GitLab CI, SMTP, Ansible Vault, AppDynamics (monitoring)                          |
| External      | You can’t find much public info — learn Ansible deeply and bridge Rex scripting on top of that |

---

## 🧠 Focus Areas for You (with your role in mind):

* **SSH-based execution with central inventory**
* **Logs + SNOW ticket triggers via Rex**
* **Using Rex jobs to call Ansible playbooks**
* **CI/CD triggers from GitLab to Rex-Ansible jobs**

---

Would you like me to generate a **sample Rex-Ansible job** for:

* NGINX deployment?
* Patching multiple Linux servers?
* Running Ansible playbooks from GitLab CI?
